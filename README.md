Java Projects Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of Java programs completed as part of my Computer Programming coursework. These projects demonstrate my understanding of fundamental programming concepts including arrays, methods, loops, classes, object-oriented programming, and problem-solving in Java.

📌 What’s Included in This Repository
	•	Java exercises and assignments
	•	Small applications demonstrating core logic
	•	Array and ArrayList projects
	•	Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) practice
	•	Utility functions and algorithm exploration
	•	Clean, commented Java code for readability

🧠 Skills Demonstrated
	•	Java syntax & fundamentals
	•	1D & 2D arrays
	•	Methods and modular programming
	•	Looping structures
	•	Scanner input handling
	•	OOP concepts: classes, objects, constructors, encapsulation
	•	Debugging and code organization

💡 Example Featured Project: Array2D Column Sum

An example Java program included in this repo:
	•	Reads user input into a 2D array
	•	Prints a specific element
	•	Calculates the sum of each column
	•	Demonstrates nested loops and method creation

  public static int sumColumn(int[][] m, int columnIndex) {
    int total = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < m.length; i++) {
        total += m[i][columnIndex];
    }
    return total;
}

🚀 How to Run These Programs
	1.	Download the .java file you want to run
	2.	Open it in your IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, VS Code, etc.)
	3.	Compile:
  javac FileName.java
  4.  Run
  java FileName
